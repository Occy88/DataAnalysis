The [R plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/r-plugin-support.html) for IntelliJ-based IDEs provides
handy capabilities to work with the [R Markdown](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/r-markdown.html) files.
To [add](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/r-markdown.html#add-code-chunk) a new R chunk,
position the caret at any line or the code chunk, then click "+".

The code chunk appears:
```{r}
``` to built and preview an output.
